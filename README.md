## HOW TO RUN AND COMPILE CODE
- Ensure you have an assembly programming environment (e.g., NASM for x86).
- Use the following steps for each task:
1. Assemble the code:

``` nasm -f elf64 <filename>.asm -o <filename>.o  ```

2. Link the object file:

``` ld <filename>.o -o <filename>  ```
3. Run the executable:

``` ./<filename>  ```
Replace ```<filename>``` with the specific task file (e.g., task1, task2, etc.).
